## Project Overview
Speaker identification is to obtain speaker identity from audio samples. 
To address this task, our research introduces a novel phonetic-based feature representation for closed-set speaker identification. This approach encapsulates speaker attributes across time and frequency domains and seamlessly integrates context information, allowing us to deduce speaker identities effectively. We also explore the effect of using distinct word classes as distinct channels within the framework. 
Moreover, we delve into the fusion of temporal and spectral domains, leveraging a *sine modulation* mechanism in the feature representation to modulate emphasis across temporal spans, resulting in a more robust and efficient identification, with the highest accuracy of 82.44%.

## Code
The code will be released soon after paper acceptance.
